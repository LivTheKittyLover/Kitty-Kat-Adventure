# Kitty-Kat-Adventure

Kitty Kat Adventure is a personal project I created with love. It is a 2D adventure "Zelda Like" story game. Kitty Kat Adventure is framed to be a game about a girl named Cleo and her cat. Her cat gets stolen by an evil baker that wants to steal all cats to make biscuts for eternity and take over the world. Cleo will have to fight bosses and level up her skills to get her cat back. It is written in java. Still in beta and gets released in huge patches.
